------------------
- Load your framework-res.apk, twframework-res.apk, and 
  SystemUI.apk into the "framework" folder, then select 
  option 5 in the main menu to install the framework.
  
- Put the APK / JAR files you want to decompile into the 
  "files_original" folder. You can either decompile them one
  at a time with option 1, or decompile the whole lot at
  once with option 2.
  
  -To compile your APK / JAR files, you can select option 3
   to choose which file you wish to compile, or you can 
   select option 4 which will compile all the decompiled
   APK / JAR files. The orignal signature files are inserted
   back into the new files. 
   
   NOTE: YOU WILL NEED TO RE-SIGN THE FILES IF YOU HAVE
   CHANGED THE ANDROIDMANIFEST.XML FILE
   
- Use option 6 to sign your files, it will also let you copy
  over any newly compiled APK / JAR files, and also has the
  support to sign ZIP files as well.
